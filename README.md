# SolsticeWebsite
Website 

<h4>What is this?</h4>
<p>Well this is the code used on my website thelostsolstice.com.</p>

<h4>Why the so Dark Style?</h4>
<p>Well I prefer darker websites due to it being easier on the eyes. That and I believe it makes the particles.js
more noticeable.</p>

<h4>Why?</h4>
<p>This is to show off different projects I have done, along with explain properly projects I host here on github.</p>
